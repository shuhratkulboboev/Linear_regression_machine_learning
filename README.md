# Linear_regression_machine_learning
In this projects, I used concrete_dat.csv dataset for my Linear Regression project and model training using Keras library.So, I made experiments namely first project was done without normalization method and second one with normalization.When I used normalization accuracy of my model improved from 78% to about 89%. I achived 89% model accuracy in this project.
